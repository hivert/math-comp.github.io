* About

Welcome to Mathematical Components' web-page! 

Mathematical Components are libraries of formalized mathematics
 developed using the [[http://coq.inria.fr][Coq]] proof assistant. This project finds its roots
 in the formal proof of the Four Color Theorem. It has been used for
 large scale formalization projects, including a formal proof of the
 Odd Order 
(Feit-Thompson) Theorem.

The libraries are written using the Ssreflect proof language, now part of
the standard distribution of the Coq proof assistant.

This is an open source project, licensed under the CeCILL-B free
software license agreement.

* Get the library

- [[file:installation.html][Here]] are installation instructions.
- The current stable release of the Mathematical Components library
  can be [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/releases][downloaded from github]].
- Older versions are available in the [[http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/FTP/"][historic archive]].


* Documentation

- The source file of each library features a documentation header
  which describes the concepts and notations introduced in that library.
  + The [[file:htmldoc/index.html][coqdoc presentation]] of the source files can be browsed online.
  + The [[file:htmldoc/libgraph.html][library graph]] can be browsed interactively.
- The Ssreflect language comes with a dedicated reference manual,
  as a [[https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/proof-engine/ssreflect-proof-language.html][chapter]] of Coq's reference manual.

- A [[https://math-comp.github.io/mcb/][book]] is in progress, and introduces the techniques for writing
  algorithms and proofs and describing the design ideas of the
  library.

* Authors and contributors

The Mathematical Components library and the Ssreflect proof language
were initially developed by the [[http://www.msr-inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/][Mathematical Components team]] at the
[[http://www.msr-inria.fr/][Inria-Microsoft Research Joint Centre]]. Today, the list of members of
the Mathematical Components organization is visible [[https://github.com/orgs/math-comp/people][here]].
