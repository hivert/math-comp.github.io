This directory contains the source files of the website
  http://math-comp.github.io/.
  
Html files pushed here are put online straight away.

By running make in htmldoc one updates the html files 
generated by coqdoc and the library graph.

Some html files are actually generated from eponymous org files
(extension `.org`). They are generated using emacs: open the
`blah.org` with emacs, press `C-c C-e h h` to generate the
corresponding `blah.html`.
